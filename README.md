# Human-Governed Job Orchestration Platform

This project is a job orchestration and automation platform that allows users to run, approve, and monitor automated jobs with human oversight.

The system is designed to ensure that automated actions are **explicitly approved**, **auditable**, and **reliable**.

## SMS Notifications (Transactional Only)

The platform uses SMS messaging **strictly for transactional and operational purposes** related to job execution and approval workflows.

Examples of SMS notifications include:
- Job approval requests
- Job execution start confirmations
- Job completion or failure notifications
- Job status responses

No marketing, promotional, or advertising messages are sent.

## SMS Opt-In and Consent

Users explicitly opt in to receive SMS messages by registering their phone number through the platform’s web dashboard.

During registration:
1. Users voluntarily provide their phone number.
2. Users are informed that SMS messages will be used for job-related notifications and approvals.
3. Users explicitly confirm consent to receive transactional SMS messages.

SMS messages are sent **only after** this opt-in process is completed.

## Managing SMS Preferences

Users may manage or disable SMS notifications at any time through the application dashboard.

Disabling SMS notifications stops all future SMS messages from being sent to the user.

---

## Message Frequency

Message frequency is variable and depends on user activity and configured job schedules.  
Typical usage is low-volume and event-driven.

---

## Compliance Statement

- Messages are transactional and user-initiated.
- Messages are required for system operation.
- No promotional content is sent.
- No third-party data is shared.
- Users retain full control over their notification preferences.
